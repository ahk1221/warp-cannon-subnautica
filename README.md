# Warp Cannon - A mod for Subnautica

# About
This requires the Oasis Mod Loader! Install it here!
https://github.com/ahk1221/oasis-sml/

# Installation
Simply build the .dll file and copy it to your Subnautica/Subnautica_Data/SMods folder. Don't forget to copy the assetbundle files(.asset and .manifest) present in the AssetBundle folder too!

# Crafting and Ammo
Crafting and ammo now both work! Yay! You will need Warp Scales (knife Warpers) to make a Warp Battery, which you can then use to craft the Warp Cannon.

# Ammo
Ammo is currently borken so until that's fixed, I'm not going to release it on Nexus.

# Spawn codes
warpcannon - Warp Cannon <br />
warpscales - Warp Scale (resource obtained by knifing Warpers. used for crafting Warp Batteries.) <br />
warpbattery - Warp Battery (used to power Warp Cannons) <br />
